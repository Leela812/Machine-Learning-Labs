**Abstract:**

This laboratory assignment explores logistic regression for binary classification tasks using synthetic and real datasets. In the binary scenario, logistic regression is applied to linearly separable synthetic data to understand decision boundaries. Additionally, the assignment delves into multiclass classification and Bayesian decision theory for binary classification. The logistic regression model is trained using a real dataset from Instagram, focusing on user demographics and ad clicking behavior. The effectiveness of the classifier is evaluated using test data, and predictions for new instances are analyzed.

**Introduction:**

Logistic regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. This laboratory assignment aims to implement logistic regression for both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. The assignment involves exploring decision boundaries in linearly separable synthetic data and applying logistic regression to a real dataset from Instagram to predict ad clicking behavior based on user demographics. Additionally, Bayesian decision theory is considered as an alternative approach to binary classification.

**Methods:**

**Task 1: Synthetic Data**

•	Split the synthetic dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets for cross-validation.
•	Visualize the synthetic data using a scatter plot to understand class distribution.
•	Implement logistic regression by developing the sigmoid function and optimizing parameters using gradient descent.
•	Generate the line of best separation on the training data using optimal parameters.
•	Predict outcomes of the test data to assess classifier efficacy.
•	Calculate classification accuracy and visualize test data with the line of best separation.

**Task 2: Real Dataset (Instagram Data)**

•	Preprocess the Instagram dataset by splitting it into training (80%) and test (20%) sets and normalizing the data.
•	Train the logistic regression model on the training data.
•	Evaluate the model's predictive ability using the test data and compare predicted outcomes with actual results.
•	Analyze the influence of age and salary on ad clicking behavior.
•	Compute classification accuracy to assess the effectiveness of the classifier.
•	Present figures for the training and test datasets to visualize the distribution of data points.

**Results:**

•	The logistic regression classifier was trained and evaluated using the provided dataset from Instagram.
•	The classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset.
•	Visual analysis of the synthetic data revealed a clear separation between positive (click) and negative (non-click) classes.
•	Analysis of the prediction results indicated that age and salary had a significant influence on the likelihood of ad clicking behavior.
•	Overall, the logistic regression model demonstrated effectiveness in predicting ad clicking behavior based on user demographics.
Discussion or Analysis:
Task 1: Synthetic Data
•	The linearly separable synthetic data allowed for clear delineation of positive and negative classes using logistic regression.
•	The sigmoid function and gradient descent optimization successfully generated the line of best separation.
Task 2: Real Dataset 
•	The logistic regression model effectively predicted ad clicking behavior based on user demographics.
•	Analysis indicated that age and salary are important factors in determining ad clicking likelihood, with older and wealthier users showing higher engagement.
 Conclusions:
Logistic regression proved to be an effective classifier for both synthetic and real datasets. The assignment demonstrated the importance of understanding decision boundaries and feature influence in binary classification tasks. Leveraging logistic regression, we can develop models to predict user behavior and enhance targeted advertising strategies on platforms like Instagram. Further research could explore additional features and algorithms to improve classification accuracy and model performance.
