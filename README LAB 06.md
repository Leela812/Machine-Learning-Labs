**Abstract:**

This report presents the results of utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for binary and multiclass classification tasks, using the Iris flower dataset. The objectives include implementing SVM for classification, exploring both binary and multiclass scenarios, and evaluating classification accuracy. 

**Introduction:**

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In this study, SVMs are applied to the Iris flower dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. The Iris dataset contains samples of Iris flowers belonging to three species, with four features measured from each sample. The goal is to classify the flowers into their respective species based on these features. 

**Methods:**

The dataset is divided into two main tasks: binary classification and multiclass classification. For binary classification, the SVM model is trained to distinguish between two classes of Iris flowers. The features are plotted, and a linear SVM classifier is trained using the training data. Support vectors are identified, and the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.

For multiclass classification, the One-Vs-All approach is employed to classify the Iris flowers into three species. Non-linear SVM classifiers are trained for each class, and prediction is performed on both the training and test datasets. Classification accuracy is calculated for both datasets using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. 

**Results:**

The results of the SVM model showcase its robust performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks. In the binary classification scenario, the model exhibited flawless accuracy, correctly classifying all instances into their respective classes. This perfect accuracy indicates the model's exceptional ability to distinguish between the two classes without any misclassifications. In the multiclass classification task, the SVM model achieved a commendable accuracy of 0.9, implying that it accurately classified 90% of the instances into their respective classes. Although not perfect, this high accuracy underscores the model's effectiveness in differentiating between the three classes, with only a few instances being misclassified. These results underscore the efficacy of SVMs in accurately classifying instances based on their features, reaffirming their status as a powerful tool in machine learning classification tasks.

**Discussion or Analysis:**

The results indicate that the SVM model achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) for binary classification, correctly distinguishing between the two classes. For multiclass classification, the accuracy was slightly lower (0.9), but still performed well in classifying the Iris flowers into their respective species. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provide insights into the model's performance for each class. 

**Conclusions:**

In conclusion, SVMs demonstrate effectiveness in classifying Iris flowers based on their features. The model achieved high accuracy for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. These results suggest the potential of SVMs for similar classification problems and highlight the importance of feature selection and model evaluation in machine learning applications
