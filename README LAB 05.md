**Abstract:**

This report explores the implementation of neural networks for classification tasks, focusing on both binary and multi-class scenarios. The methods include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for training neural networks and experimentation with varying numbers of hidden neurons. Additionally, a multi-class neural network is developed using Python tools. The effectiveness of these approaches are evaluated using datasets for solving the XOR problem and predicting car acceptability. 

**Introduction:**

Neural networks are powerful machine learning models widely used for classification tasks. This report investigates their application in solving classification problems such as the XOR problem and car acceptability prediction. The XOR problem presents a binary classification challenge, while car acceptability prediction involves multi-class classification. Various methods are employed, including Stochastic Gradient Descent and experimentation with different numbers of hidden neurons. The objective is to assess the performance of neural networks in solving these tasks. 

**Methods:**

The methods involve implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent to train neural networks for the XOR problem, using Python tools for multi-class prediction, and experimenting with different configurations of hidden neurons. For the XOR problem, a three-layer neural network architecture with sigmoid activation functions is utilized. The datasets are preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and shuffled for training. Additionally, regularization techniques are applied to combat overfitting. The performance metrics include classification accuracy and cost function evaluation. 

**Results:**

In solving the XOR problem, experimentation with different numbers of hidden neurons reveals varying decision regions and cost functions. For car acceptability prediction, training neural networks with different numbers of hidden neurons yields distinct classification accuracies and final costs. Regularization improves model performance in terms of accuracy and cost reduction. 

**Discussion or Analysis:**

The results demonstrate the impact of hidden neuron configuration on the performance of neural networks. Increasing the number of hidden neurons generally improves classification accuracy but may lead to overfitting without regularization. The effectiveness of regularization in mitigating overfitting is evident from the results. Moreover, the choice of activation functions and optimization algorithms influences model convergence and performance.

**Conclusions:**

Neural networks offer a versatile approach to classification tasks, as demonstrated by their effectiveness in solving the XOR problem and car acceptability prediction. Experimentation with different configurations highlights the importance of parameter tuning and regularization in improving model performance. Overall, neural networks prove to be valuable tools for various classification tasks, with their performance influenced by architectural choices and optimization techniques.
